Introductory data analytics with Python and Jupyter Notebooks 

(one full day in length, broken up into morning and afternoon sessions)


Description: 

This course teaches participants with no prior programming or data analytics experience how to perform data manipulation, data analysis and data visualisation in Python. Users will be able to understand the capabilities of data analytics and align business goals with techniques. Programming will be performed in a Jupyter notebook environment.  Jupyter notebooks are powerful and compelling tools, and have become ultra popular among data scientists.  A Jupyter notebook is a document that supports mixing executable code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text and allows to generate reports dynamically. It is a free and open source platform.

Outline:

1. Introduction to Python;
2. Loading and manipulating data (reshaping, missing values);
3. Data visualisation;
4. Descriptive Statistics (mean, standard deviation, etc);
5. Inferential Statistics (anova, regression, classification).

Learning outcomes:

On completion of this module the learner will be able to:

1. Write basic scripts in Python;
2. Visualise data;
3. Summarise data;
4. Draw conclusions from data;
5. Generate reports from Jupyter notebooks.


Prerequisites:

There are 2 options:

1. Local installation of the open-source Anaconda Distribution (Python 3.7 version)
